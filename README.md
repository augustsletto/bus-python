# Bus Management System

This Python-based command-line program simulates a bus management system. The program allows users to manage passengers on a bus by performing various actions.

## Usage

- **Add Passengers:** Add passengers to the bus by entering their age and gender.
- **View Passenger List:** Display the list of passengers currently on the bus.
- **Calculate Total Age:** Calculate the total age of all passengers on the bus.
- **Calculate Average Age:** Calculate the average age of passengers on the bus.
- **Find Oldest Passenger:** Identify the oldest passenger on the bus.
- **Filter Passengers by Age:** Find passengers within a specific age range.
- **Sort Passengers:** Sort the list of passengers by age in descending order.
- **View Gender Count:** Display the count of passengers based on gender.
- **Poke and Remove Passengers:** Interactively poke or remove passengers from their seat.

## Testing

### Overview

The Bus Management System underwent testing to ensure functionality and responsiveness across different user interactions.

### Test Cases

- **Functionality**: Verified all features (adding passengers, data calculations, sorting, and removing passengers) for accuracy and expected behavior.
- **Interface Testing**: Ensured a user-friendly interface and ease of use during passenger management operations.
- **Input Validation**: Checked for appropriate handling of user inputs, including age and gender entries.
- **Compatibility Testing**: Confirmed compatibility across different environments and systems.

### Tools Used

- **Manual Testing**: Conducted various manual tests to assess user interactions and functionality.
- **Code Institute Python Linter**: Utilized CI Python Linter automated testing.
- **Systematic Testing**: Employed systematic methods to ensure comprehensive coverage of all functionalities.

### Test Results

The project passed all test cases, showcasing consistent performance and accurate functionality across various scenarios.
